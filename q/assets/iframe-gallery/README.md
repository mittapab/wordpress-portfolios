# NSB-Box
Another lightbox alternative?

Yes, but it's not easy to find a lightbox which is able to float 
windows and images in a very simple way.
Programmed as an hommage to the «thickbox» of codylindley.com 
with the cool clame, "one box to rule them all", I wanted to program
a simple floating script which uses the latest version of jQuery and 
which is mobile compatible.
Yes, you can swipe the pictures with your fingers. 

My focus was on simplicity, the simple css class «nsbbox» does the magic.

Features:
• Autochecks for other pictures which use «nsbbox» and make them 
  available via left and right arrows.
• swiping on mobile devices.
• CSS is simple and compatible to mobile, easy for you to change.
• Able to add width or height or no scrolling attribute with html data
  data-width="500" data-height="400" data-scrolling="no".
• Blends out arrows when only one img is linked in the page.
• Ignores url attributes and even with them checks if the linked content 
  is a picture or an iframe. Example: bilder/image.jpg?v=3838

To be done:
• make accessible for div elements which are used within the page.
